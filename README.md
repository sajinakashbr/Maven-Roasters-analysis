# Maven-Roasters-analysis
This project is about analyzing the sales data of **Maven Roasters**, a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. After some _data preprocessing_ process and _data cleaning_, I have made an **interactive dashboard** in **Power BI** to visualize the sales analysis of Maven Roasters.
