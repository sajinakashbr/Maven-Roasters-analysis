# Maven-Roasters-analysis
This project is about analyzing the sales data of Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. After some data preprocessing process and data cleaning, I have made an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the sales analysis of Maven Roasters.
